INTRODUCTION                                             *orgguide-introduction*

Preface~
   Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
   project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system. It is also
   an authoring and publishing system.

   This document is a a copy of the orgmode-guide for emacs with modifications
   for vim. It contains all basic features and commands, along with important 
   hints for customization.

==============================================================================
DOCUMENT STRUCTURE                                       *orgguide-docstructure*

Org is based on Outline mode and provides flexible commands to edit the
structure of the document.


Outlines~
   Org is implemented on top of Outline mode. Outlines allow a document to
   be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me) is the
   best representation of notes and thoughts. An overview of this structure
   is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document to show only
   the general document structure and the parts currently being worked on.
   Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by compressing the entire
   show/hide functionality into a single command, =org-cycle=, which is
   bound to the <TAB> key.


Headlines~
   Headlines define the structure of an outline tree. The headlines in Org
   start with one or more stars, on the left margin[[#FOOT1][(1)]]. For
   example:

>
    * Top level headline
    ** Second level
    *** 3rd level
        some text
    *** 3rd level
        more text

    * Another top level headline
<

   Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
   that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
   [[#Clean-view][A cleaner outline view]], describes a setup to realize
   this.

Visibility cycling~
   Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer. Org
   uses just two commands, bound to <TAB> and S-<TAB> to change the
   visibility in the buffer.

   <TAB> :: /Subtree cycling/: Rotate current subtree among the states

>
       ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
       '-----------------------------------'
<

   When called with a prefix argument (C-u <TAB>) or with the shift key,
   global cycling is invoked.

   S-<TAB> and C-u <TAB> :: /Global cycling/: Rotate the entire buffer
   among the states

>
       ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
       '--------------------------------------'
<

   C-u C-u C-u <TAB> :: Show all, including drawers.

   When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
   OVERVIEW, i.e. only the top level headlines are visible. This can be
   configured through the variable =org-startup-folded=, or on a per-file
   basis by adding a startup keyword =overview=, =content=, =showall=, like
   this:

>
    #+STARTUP: content
<
