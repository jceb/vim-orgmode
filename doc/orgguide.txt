INTRODUCTION                                 *vim-orgmode* *orgguide-introduction*

Vim-orgmode: Text outlining and task management for Vim based on Emacs'
Org-Mode.

The idea for this plugin was born by listening to the Floss Weekly podcast
introducing Emacs' Org-Mode (http://twit.tv/floss136). Org-Mode has a lot of
strong features like folding, views (sparse tree) and scheduling of tasks.
These are completed by hyperlinks, tags, todo states, priorities aso.

Vim-orgmode aims at providing the same functionality for Vim and for command
line tools*.

* for command line tools and other programs a library liborgmode is provided.
  It encapsulates all functionality for parsing and modifying org files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preface~
   vim-orgmode is a file type plugin for keeping notes, maintaining TODO
   lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text
   system. It is also an authoring and publishing system.

   This document is a copy of the orgmode-guide for emacs
   (http://orgmode.org/) with modifications for vim. It contains all basic
   features and commands, along with important hints for customization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features~
  vim-orgmode is still very young but already quite usable. Here is a short
  list of the already supported features:

  - Cycle visibility of headings
  - Navigate between headings
  - Edit the structure of the document: add, move, promote, denote headings
    and more
  - Hyperlinks within vim-orgmode and outside (files, webpages, etc.)
  - TODO list management
  - Tags for headings
  - Basic date handling
  - Export (via emacs)

  More features are coming...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default mappings~
                                                                  *org-mappings*
Here is a short overview of the default mappings. They also can be invoked
via the 'Org' menu. Most are only usable in command mode.

  Show/Hide:~
    <TAB>           - Cycle Visibility

    <localleader>eh     - export as HTML

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation~
  Download the latest stable release at
  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3642

  Open the vimball archive in vim and source it.

  $ vim orgmode.vba
>
    :so %
<

  ATTENTION: All .pyc files of former versions of vim-orgmode need to be
  deleted beforehand!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activation~
  Add the following line to your .vimrc file to ensure that filetype plugins
  are loaded properly:
>
  filetype plugin indent on
<

  Please install the Universal Text Linking
  (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=293) addon, otherwise
  hyperlinks won't work. Other plugins that integrate well with vim orgmode
  are listed in the following section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suggested plugins~
  Universal Text Linking~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=293) general support for
    text linking. The hyperlinks feature of vim-orgmode depends on this plugin.

  repeat~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2136)
    Repeat actions that would not be repeatable otherwise. This plugin is
    needed when you want to repeat the previous orgmode action.

  taglist~
    ([http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273)
    Display tags for the currently edited file. Vim-orgmode ships with support
    for displaying the heading structure and hyperlinks in the taglist plugin.

  tagbar~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465)
    A new approach to displaying tags for the currently edited file.
    Vim-orgmode ships with support for displaying the heading structure and
    hyperlinks in the tagbar plugin.

  speeddating~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2120)
    In-/decrease dates the vim way: C-a and C-x. Dates and times in the
    orgmode format can be in-/decreased if this plugins is installed.

  Narrow Region~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3075)
    Emulation of Emacs' Narrow Region feature. It might be useful when dealing
    with large orgmode files.

  pathogen~
    (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332)
    Easy management of multiple vim plugins.

==============================================================================
DOCUMENT STRUCTURE                                       *orgguide-docstructure*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outlines~
  Outlines allow a document to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which
  (at least for me) is the best representation of notes and thoughts. An
  overview of this structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of
  the document to show only the general document structure and the parts
  currently being worked on. vim-orgmode greatly simplifies the use of
  outlines by compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single
  command, <Plug>OrgToggleFolding, which is bound to the <TAB> key.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Headlines~
  Headlines define the structure of an outline tree. The headlines in
  vim-orgmode start with one or more stars, on the left margin. For example:
>
  * Top level headline
  ** Second level
  *** 3rd level
      some text
  *** 3rd level
      more text

  * Another top level headline
<

  Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
  that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
  |g:org_heading_shade_leading_stars| describes a setup to realize this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Text objects~
  Vim offers a mighty feature called |text-objects|. A text object is bound to
  a certain character sequence that can be used in combination with all kinds
  of editing and selection tasks.

  vim-orgmode implements a number of text objects to make editing org files
  easier:

  ih                    inner heading, referring to the current heading
                        excluding the heading level characters (*)
  ah                    a heading, referring to the current heading including
                        everything
  ir                    inner subtree, starting with the current heading
  ar                    a subtree, starting with the current heading
  Oh                    inner outer heading, referring to the parent
  Or                    inner outer heading, including subtree, referring to
                        the parent
  OH                    an outer heading
  OT                    an outer subtree

  Motions can be used like text objects as well. See |orgguide-motion|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visibility cycling~
  Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
  vim-orgmode uses just two commands, bound to <Tab> and <S-Tab> to change the
  visibility in the buffer.

  <Tab>       or                                *orgguide-Tab* or *orgguide-S-Tab*
  <S-Tab>               Subtree cycling: Rotate current subtree among the
                        states
>
  ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
  '-----------------------------------'
<

  When called with the shift key, global cycling is invoked.

  <LocalLeader>,    or      *orgguide-<LocalLeader>,* or *orgguide-<LocalLeader>.*
  <LocalLeader>.        Global cycling: Rotate the entire buffer among the
                        states. The same can be achieved by using the
                        keybindings zm and zr.
>
  ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
  '--------------------------------------'
<

  Vim-orgmode doesn't implement the following functionality, yet.~
  When Emacs first visits an org file, the global state is set to
  OVERVIEW, i.e. only the top level headlines are visible. This can be
  configured through the variable =org-startup-folded=, or on a per-file
  basis by adding a startup keyword =overview=, =content=, =showall=, like
  this:
>
   #+STARTUP: content
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motion~
                                                               *orgguide-motion*
  The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

  }                     Next heading.

  {                     Previous heading.

  ]]                    Next heading same level.

  [[                    Previous heading same level.

  g{                    Backward to higher level heading.

  g}                    Forward to higher level heading.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Structure editing~

                                                                 *orgguide-S-CR*
  <S-CR>                Insert new heading with same level as current. If the
                        cursor is in a plain list item, a new item is created
                        (see section [[#Plain-lists][Plain lists]]). When this
                        command is used in the middle of a line, the line is
                        split and the rest of the line becomes the new
                        headline.

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  M-S-<CR>              Insert new TODO entry with same level as current
                        heading.

  <Tab>         or
  <S-Tab>               In a new entry with no text yet, <Tab> and <S-Tab>
                        will cycle through reasonable levels.

  <<            or                              *orgguide-<<* or *orgguide-CTRL-d*
  <C-d> (insert mode)   Promote current heading by one level.

  >>            or                              *orgguide->>* or *orgguide-CTRL-t*
  <C-t> (insert mode)   Demote current heading by one level.

                                                                  *orgguide-<[[*
  <[[                   Promote the current subtree by one level.

                                                                  *orgguide->]]*
  >]]                   Demote the current subtree by one level.

                                                                   *orgguide-m{*
  m{                    Move heading up (swap with previous/next subtree of
                        same level).

                                                                   *orgguide-m}*
  m}                    Move heading down (swap with previous/next subtree of
                        same level).

                                                                  *orgguide-m[[*
  m[[                   Move subtree up (swap with previous/next subtree of
                        same level).

                                                                  *orgguide-m]]*
  m]]                   Move subtree down (swap with previous/next subtree of
                        same level).

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  C-c C-w                Refile entry or region to a different location. See
                        section [[#Refiling-notes][Refiling notes]].

                                                           *orgguide-<Leader>nr*
  <Leader>nr            Narrow buffer to current subtree / widen it again
                        (only if NarrowRegion plugin is installed)

  When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and demotion
  work on all headlines in the region.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sparse trees~
    Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plain lists~
  Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
  additional structure.

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  They also provide a way to create lists of checkboxes (see section
  |orgguide-checkboxes|).

  vim-orgmode supports editing such lists, and the HTML exporter (see section
  |orgguide-export|) parses and formats them.

  vim-orgmode knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

  -  'Unordered' list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’ as bullets.
  -  'Ordered' list items start with ‘1.’ or ‘1)’.
  -  'Description' list use ‘ :: ’ to separate the 'term' from the
     description.

  Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the
  first line. An item ends before the next line that is indented like its
  bullet/number, or less. A list ends when all items are closed, or before
  two blank lines. An example:
>
  ** Lord of the Rings
     My favorite scenes are (in this order)
     1. The attack of the Rohirrim
     2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
        + this was already my favorite scene in the book
        + I really like Miranda Otto.
     Important actors in this film are:
     - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
     - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
<

  The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line
  of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

==============================================================================
TABLES                                                         *orgguide-tables*
  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~

==============================================================================
HYPERLINKS                                                 *orgguide-hyperlinks*

NOTE: The |utl| plugin is used for this feature and needs to be installed.
      http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=293

Like HTML, vim-orgmode provides links inside a file, external links to other
files, Usenet articles, emails, and much more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Link format~
                                                           *orgguide-linkformat*
  vim-orgmode will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as links.
  The general link format, however, looks like this:
>
    [[link][description]]       or alternatively           [[link]]
<

  Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), and you are
  not in insert mode, or you are editing another line, vim-orgmode will change
  the display so that 'description' is displayed instead of
  '[[link][description]]' and 'link' is displayed instead of '[[link]]'.  To
  edit the invisible ‘link’ part, go into insert mode, or call the
  'Insert/edit Link' command by pressing 'gil'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internal links~
  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
External links~
  |utl| supports links to files and websites. Others can be added by extending
  utl (see |utl-smartSamples|).  External links are URL-like locators. They
  start with a short identifying string followed by a colon. There can be no
  space after the colon. Here are some examples:
>
    http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik          on the web
    file:/home/dominik/images/jupiter.jpg     file, absolute path
    /home/dominik/images/jupiter.jpg          same as above
<

  A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a descriptive
  text to be displayed instead of the URL (see section |orgguide-linkformat|),
  for example:
>
    [[http://www.vim.org/][VIM]]
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handling links~
  vim-orgmode provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to
  insert it into an org file, and to follow the link.

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  C-c l                 Store a link to the current location. This is a
                        /global/ command (you must create the key binding
                        yourself) which can be used in any buffer to create a
                        link. The link will be stored for later insertion into
                        an org buffer (see below).

                                                                  *orgguide-gil*
  gil                   Insert a link. This prompts for a link to be inserted
                        into the buffer. You can just type a link, or use
                        history keys <Up> and <Down> to access stored links.
                        You will be prompted for the description part of the
                        link. File name completion is enabled to link to a
                        local file. In addition vim-orgmode provides the
                        command :OrgHyperlinkInsert to insert a link from
                        command line.

  gil                   When the cursor is on an existing link, gil allows you
                        to edit the link and description parts of the link.

TODO ITEMS                                                       *orgguide-todo*

vim-orgmode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents. Instead,
TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because TODO items usually
come up while taking notes! With vim-orgmode, simply mark any entry in a tree as
being a TODO item. In this way, information is not duplicated, and the entire
context from which the TODO item emerged is always present.

Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them throughout
your notes file. vim-orgmode compensates for this by providing methods to give
you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using TODO states~

  Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word ‘TODO’,
  for example:
>
      *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune
<

  The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

  <LocalLeader>t        Rotate the TODO state of the current item among. See
                        |orgguide-tags-settings|for more information.
>
       ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
       '--------------------------------'
<

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  The same rotation can also be done “remotely” from the timeline and
  agenda buffers with the t command key (see section
  |orgguide-agenda-commands|).

  <S-right> or <S-left> Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to
                        cycling.

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  C-c / t               View TODO items in a /sparse tree/ (see section
                        [[#Sparse-trees][Sparse trees]]). Folds the buffer,
                        but shows all TODO items and the headings hierarchy
                        above them.

  <LocalLeader>cat      Show the global TODO list. This collects the TODO
                        items from all agenda files (see section
                        |orgguide-agenda-views|) into a single buffer.

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  S-M-<CR>              Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-state workflows~

  You can use TODO keywords to indicate different 'sequential' states in
  the process of working on an item, for example:
>
  :let g:org_todo_keywords=['TODO', 'FEEDBACK', 'VERIFY', '|', 'DONE', 'DELEGATED']
<

  The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that 'need action')
  from the DONE states (which need 'no further action'). If you don’t
  provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE state.
  With this setup, the command <S-Right> will cycle an entry from TODO to
  FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.

  Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
  parallel. For example, you may want to have the basic TODO/DONE, but
  also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating that an
  item has been canceled (so it is not DONE, but also does not require
  action). Your setup would then look like this:
>
  :let g:org_todo_keywords = [['TODO(t)', '|', 'DONE(d)'],
      \ ['REPORT(r)', 'BUG(b)', 'KNOWNCAUSE(k)', '|', 'FIXED(f)'],
      \ ['CANCELED(c)']]
<
  The keywords should all be different, this helps vim-orgmode to keep track
  of which subsequence should be used for a given entry. The example also
  shows how to define keys for fast access of a particular state, by
  adding a letter in parenthesis after each keyword - you will be prompted
  for the key after pressing ,d.

                                                       *orgguide-<LocalLeader>d*
  <LocalLeader>d        prompt for fast access of a todo state

  Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
  To define TODO keywords that are valid only in a single file, use the
  following text anywhere in the file.

>
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+TODO: TODO(t) | DONE(d)
      #+TODO: REPORT(r) BUG(b) KNOWNCAUSE(k) | FIXED(f)
      #+TODO: | CANCELED(c)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
<

  After changing one of these lines, use C-c C-c with the cursor still in
  the line to make the changes known to vim-orgmode.

TAGS                                                             *orgguide-tags*

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign 'tags' to headlines. vim-orgmode has extensive
support for tags.

Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of the
headline. Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, ‘_’, and
‘@’. Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
‘:work:’. Several tags can be specified, as in ‘:work:urgent:’. Tags
will by default be in bold face with the same color as the headline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag inheritance~

                                                        *orgguide-tags-settings*
  Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline. After
  a colon, <TAB> offers completion on tags. There is also a special
  command for inserting tags:

                                                       *orgguide-<LocalLeader>t*
  <LocalLeader>t        Enter new tags for the current headline. vim-orgmode
                        will either offer completion or a special single-key
                        interface for setting tags, see below.  After pressing
                        <CR>, the tags will be inserted and aligned to
                        'org-tags-column'.

  vim-orgmode will support tag insertion based on a 'list of tags'. By default
  this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags currently used
  in the buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag searches~
                                                          *orgguide-tags-search*

DATES AND TIMES                                                 *orgguide-dates*

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time. The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a 'timestamp' in vim-orgmode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timestamps~

  A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a range of
  times) in a special format, either <2003-09-16 Tue> or <2003-09-16 Tue
  09:39> or <2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>. A timestamp can appear anywhere in
  the headline or body of an org tree entry.  Its presence causes entries to
  be shown on specific dates in the agenda (see section |orgguide-agenda|). We
  distinguish:

  Plain timestamp; Event; Appointment ~
    A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item. This is just like
    writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
>
    * Meet Peter at the movies <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
    * Discussion on climate change <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

>
    ** Meeting in Amsterdam
       <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
<
  Inactive timestamp~
    Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of angular
    ones. These timestamps are inactive in the sense that they do 'not'
    trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.
>
    * Gillian comes late for the fifth time [2006-11-01 Wed]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating timestamps~

  For vim-orgmode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
  format. All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct format.

                                                      *orgmode-<LocalLeader>-sa*
  <LocalLeader>sa       Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.

                        Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
                        When the cursor is at an existing timestamp in the
                        buffer, the command is used to modify this timestamp
                        instead of inserting a new one.

                        Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
                        When this command is used twice in succession, a time
                        range is inserted. With a prefix, also add the current
                        time.

                                                       *orgmode-<LocalLeader>si*
  <LocalLeader>si       Like |orgmode-<LocalLeader>-sa|, but insert an inactive
                        timestamp that will not cause an agenda entry.

                                              *orgmode-ctrl-a* or *orgmode-ctrl-x*
  CTRL-A or CTRL-X      Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.
                        The cursor can be on a year, month, day, hour or
                        minute.  NOTE: The plugin 'speeddating' should be
                        installed for this feature.

                        Not yet implemented in vim-orgmode~
                        When the timestamp contains a time range like
                        ‘15:30-16:30’, modifying the first time will also
                        shift the second, shifting the time block with
                        constant length.  To change the length, modify the
                        second time.

  When vim-orgmode prompts for a date/time, it will accept any string
  containing some date and/or time information, and intelligently interpret
  the string, deriving defaults for unspecified information from the current
  date and time. See the manual for more information on how exactly the
  date/time prompt works.

AGENDA VIEWS                                                   *orgguide-agenda*

Due to the way vim-orgmode works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files. To get
an overview of open action items, or of events that are important for a
particular date, this information must be collected, sorted and displayed in
an organized way. There are several different views, see below.

The extracted information is displayed in a special agenda buffer. This
buffer is read-only.

... but provides commands to visit the corresponding locations in the original
org files, and even to edit these files remotely.  Remote editing from the
agenda buffer means, for example, that you can change the dates of deadlines
and appointments from the agenda buffer. The commands available in the Agenda
buffer are listed in |orgguide-agenda-commands|.

- |orgguide-agenda-files|          Files being searched for agenda information

  The weekly/daily agenda~
    The purpose of the weekly/daily 'agenda' is to act like a page of a
    paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

                                                     *orgguide-<LocalLeader>caa*

Remapping shortcuts~
  vim-orgmode provides an easy way for remapping the default keyboard
  shortcuts. For this task it relies on vim's <Plug> mappings. All shortcuts
  of vim-orgmode are accessible by <Plug>s.

  To change a keyboard shortcut the name of the related <Plug> is needed.
  First we need to look up the current mapping in the Org menu. The following
  command reveals the <Plug>'s name:
>
  :map <current_mapping>
<

  The result should look something like this:
>
  :map ,t
  n ,t @<Plug>OrgSetTags
<

  Now we can create an alternate mapping:
>
  nmap <new_mapping> <the_plug>
<

  To change the mapping for editing tags to <leader>t the vimrc entry would
  look like this:
>
  nmap <leader>t @<Plug>OrgSetTags
<

DEVELOPMENT                                               *orgguide-development*

The development of vim-orgmode is coordinated via github:
  https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode

If you like this project, have questions, suggestions or problems, simply drop
us a line and open an issue. Patches are very welcome!

Here is a quick start about the vim-orgmode development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Structure and Source Code~
  The majority of the source code is stored in folder ftplugin/orgmode. This
  is where the actual functionality of the plugin is located.

  I choose to implement vim-orgmode mainly in Python. I hope this will ease
  the implementation especially with the functionality of the Python standard
  library at hand.

  Right below the directory ftplugin/orgmode the basic implementation of
  vim-orgmode is found. This basic functionality provides everything for
  higher level implementations that modify the buffer, provide a menu and
  keybindings to the user and everything else that is needed.

  Below the directory ftplugin/orgmode/plugins the plugins are located. Every
  plugin must provide a class equal to its filename with the .py-extension.
  An example for a plugin can be found in file
  ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/Example.py.

  Every plugin must be enabled by the user by setting the g:org_plugins
  variable. By default all shipped plugins are enabled.  Example:
>
    let g:org_plugins = ['ShowHide', '|', 'Navigator', 'EditStructure']
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing a plugin~
  To write a plugin:
  1. copy file ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/Example.py to
     ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/YourPlugin.py
  2. Change class name to "YourPlugin"
  3. Set the menu name, it doesn't need to match the filename anymore, e.g.
     "Your Plugin"
  4. Prepare keybindings in function register by defining a proper action and
     a key this action should be mapped to. For further information refer to
     section Keybindings.
  5. Register your plugin:
>
  let g:org_plugins = ['ShowHide', '|', 'Navigator', 'EditStructure',
    \ 'YourPlugin']
<

  6. Write unittests and implement YourPlugin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keybindings~
  Keybindings alias mappings are described very well in the vim
  documentation, see |map-modes|. vim-orgmode tries to make it easy for the
  developer to register new keybindings, make them customizable and provide
  menu entries so that the user can access the functionality like in original
  orgmode.

  This is done by providing three classes: Keybinding, Plug and ActionEntry

  Keybinding~
    This is the basic class that encapsulates a single keybinding consisting
    of a key/mapping and an action. Several options can be set when creating
    the object to specify the mode and all kinds of other things.

    If a Plug is given instead of an action string the Plug is bound to the
    key. All relevant data is read from the Plug, e.g. name, mode aso.

    Example~
      Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode:
>
      Keybinding('g{', \
        ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>', \
        mode=MODE_NORMAL)

      vim -> :nmap g{
        \ :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
<

      Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:
>
      Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', \
        ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))

      vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal :py
        \ ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
      vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
<

  Plug~
    A Plug is a unique keybinding that can not be executed by pressing
    any key. This makes it a special Keybinding that takes a name and
    an action to create an object. A plug normally goes together with a
    regular Keybinding to bind the Plug to a key.

    This special behavior is needed to ensure that keybindings are
    customizable by the user. If the user creates a keybinding to a
    Plug the Keybinding object makes sure that the users keybinding is
    used and the keybinding specified by the plugin is not used.

    Example~
      Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:
>
      Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', \
        ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))

      vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
        \ :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
      vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
<

  ActionEntry~
    An ActionEntry makes Keybindings accessible by the vim menu. It takes a
    description and a Keybinding object and builds a menu entry from this. The
    resulting object can be added to a Submenu object by using the + operator.

    Example~
      Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:
>
      k = Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', \
        ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))

      vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
        \ :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
      vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal

      menu + ActionEntry('&Up', k)
      vim -> :nmenu &Org.&Naviagte Headings.&Up<Tab>g{
        \ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building a Vimball~
  Vimball is an archive format for vim plugins. It's of use when you want to
  install vim-orgmode for a single user. To build a Vimball just run the
  following command in the root folder of this plugin.  Please make sure that
  vim is installed on your computer:
>
  make vbm
<
  For installing the plugin form the resulting orgmode.vbm.gz file, please
  refer to the Installation section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building a Debian Package~
   A Debian package is of use when you want to make vim-orgmode available to
   all users on your computer. Make sure you've debhelper and vim installed,
   than run the following command from the root directory of this plugin to
   build the debian package:
>
   dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
<
   For installing the plugin form the resulting vim-orgmode_X.X.X-X.deb file,
   please refer to the Installation section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating Tests Cases~
  For every plugin it's important to write automated test cases. This is
  important to ensure that little changes don't break things at the other end
  of the project.

  vim-orgmode relies on Pyunit (http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html).
  All tests are located in the tests directory. Run
>
  make test
<

  to run all tests. To create a new test the test should be added to the
  corresponding test file.

  In case a new plugin is created a new test file needs to be created as well.
  The test needs to be added to the test suite located in the file
  tests/run_tests.py.

  Finally the
>
  make coverage
<

  should be run. The result shows the test coverage of all project files. One
  hundred percent (100%) is of course the goal :-)
