* Vim-OrgMode

  [[https://secure.travis-ci.org/jceb/vim-orgmode.png?branch=master]]

  Text outlining and task management for Vim based on [[http://orgmode.org/][Emacs' Org-Mode]].

  The idea for this plugin was born by listening to the
  [[http://twit.tv/floss136][Floss Weekly podcast]] introducing Emacs Org-Mode.
  Org-Mode has a lot of strong features like folding, views (sparse tree) and
  scheduling of tasks.  These are completed by hyperlinks, tags, todo states,
  priorities aso.

  vim-orgmode aims at providing the same functionality for Vim.

   - TODO list management
   - Tags for headings
   - Lists in alphanumeric and bullet item notation and checkbox support
