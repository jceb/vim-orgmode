An attempt to build org-mode for vim (http://orgmode.org)

Information about the license are found in the file LICENSE

* Installation

** Prerequisites
   Add the following lines to your .vimrc file to ensure that plugins
   are loaded properly:

	filetype on
	filetype plugin on
	filetype indent on

** From .vba file
   Open the file in vim and run the command ":so %". The plugin is than
   installed into your .vim directory.

   In case you want to install the plugin into a specific directory when
   you are using pathogen, e.g. $HOME/.vim/bundle/orgmode, then add this
   directory as the first one to the runtimepath and execute ":so %" as
   described.

   :set rtp=$HOME/.vim/bundle/orgmode,&rtp
   :so %

** From git checkout
   Copy the directories ftdetect, ftplugin, indent and syntax to your
   $HOME/.vim directory or the bundle directory in case you are using
   pathogen.

* Usage
  vim-orgmode aims to be clone of the original orgmode for Emacs. Since
  Emacs is not vim the clone is not aiming for 100% compatibility.
  Especially in terms of the keybindings there will be major
  differences!

  You'll definitively enjoy the modal interface, this where vim's
  strength is. Almost all keybindings for orgmode work only in normal
  and visual mode where as in insert mode just a few are available.

  To start vim-orgmode open a file with the extension .org. An
  additional menu "Org" is shown that gives an overview of the
  implemented functionality and the keybindings.

** Text objects
   Vim offers a mighty feature called text-objects. A text-object is
   bound to a certain character sequence that can be used in combination
   with all kinds of editing and selection tasks. vim-orgmode offers the
   following text-objects:

   ih - inner heading, referring to the current heading excluding the heading level characters (*)
   ah - a heading, referring to the current heading including everything
   it - inner subtree, starting with the current heading
   at - a subtree, starting with the current heading
   Oh - inner outer heading, referring to the parent
   Ot - inner outer heading, including subtree, referring to the parent
   OH - a outer heading
   OT - a outer subtree

   Movement commands can also be used for editing like text-objects:

   g{ - execute command from current position to the beginning of the parent heading
   { - execute command from current position to the beginning of the current heading
   } - execute command from current position to the end of the current heading
   [[ - execute command from current position to the beginning of the previous heading sibling
   ]] - execute command from current position to the end of the next heading sibling

   For further information please read :h text-objects-changed

* Suggested plugins
  - pathogen, for an easy management of multiple plugins, (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332)
  - repeat (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2136)
  - taglist (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273)
  - speeddating (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2120)
  - Narrow Region (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3075)
  - Ultimate Text Linking (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=293)

* Development

** Building Vimball
   orgmode.vba is a Vimball archive containing all files that are needed
   by the plugin. It's installable, see Installation.

   To build orgmode.vba.gz just run make in the root folder of this
   plugin.

** Source code

*** Files and folders
	build_vim - Build file for the Vimball
	ftdetect/ - Filetype detection for orgmode files
	ftplugin/ - Home of the main part of the plugin
	ftplugin/orgmode/ - Home for all Python code related to the plugin
	ftplugin/orgmode/plugins - Home for all orgmode plugins
	indent/ - Indentation for orgmode files
	LICENSE - License Information
	Makefile - Build file for the Vimball
	README - This file
	syntax/ - Syntax highlighting
	test/ - Tests to verify the consistency and correctness of the plugin

*** Structure
	The majority of the source code is stored in folder
	ftplugin/orgmode. This is where the actual functionality of the
	plugin is located.

	I choose to implement vim-orgmode mainly in Python. I hope this will
	ease the implementation especially with the functionality of the
	Python standard library at hand.

	Right below the directory ftplugin/orgmode the basic implementation
	of vim-orgmode is found. This basic functionality provides
	everything for higher level implementations that modify the buffer,
	provide a menu and keybindings to the user and everything else that
	is needed.

	Below the directory ftplugin/orgmode/plugins the plugins are
	located. Every plugin must provide a class equal to its filename
	with the .py-extension. An example for a plugin can be found in file
	ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/Example.py.

	Every plugin must be enabled by the user by setting the
	g:org_plugins variable. By default all shipped plugins are enabled.
	Example:

	let g:org_plugins = ['ShowHide', '|', 'Navigator', 'EditStructure']

*** Writing a plugin
	To write a plugin:
	1. copy file ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/Example.py to
	   ftplugin/orgmode/plugins/YourPlugin.py
	2. Change class name to "YourPlugin"
	3. Set the menu name, it doesn't need to match the filename anymore,
	   e.g. "Your Plugin"
	4. Prepare keybindings in function register by defining a proper
	   action and a key this action should be mapped to. For further
	   information refer to section Keybindings.
	5. Register your plugin:
	   let g:org_plugins = ['ShowHide', '|', 'Navigator', 'EditStructure', 'YourPlugin']
	6. Implement YourPlugin

*** Keybindings
	Keybindings alias mappings are described very well in the vim
	documentation, see |map-modes|. vim-orgmode tries to make it easy
	for the developer to register new keybindings, make them
	customizable and provide menu entries so that the user can access
	the functionality like in original orgmode.

	This is done by providing three classes: Keybinding, Plug and ActionEntry

**** Keybinding
	 This is the basic class that encapsulates a single keybinding
	 consisting of a key/mapping and an action. Several options can be
	 set when creating the object to specify the mode and all kinds of
	 other things.

	 If a Plug is given instead of an action string the Plug is bound to
	 the key. All relevant data is read from the Plug, e.g. name, mode
	 aso.

***** Example
	  Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode:

	  Keybinding('g{', ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>', mode=MODE_NORMAL)
	  vim -> :nmap g{ :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>

	  Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:

	  Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))
	  vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
	  vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal

**** Plug
	 A Plug is a unique keybinding that can not be executed by pressing
	 any key. This makes it a special Keybinding that takes a name and
	 an action to create an object. A plug normally goes together with a
	 regular Keybinding to bind the Plug to a key.

	 This special behavior is needed to ensure that keybindings are
	 customizable by the user. If the user creates a keybinding to a
	 Plug the Keybinding object makes sure that the users keybinding is
	 used and the keybinding specified by the plugin is not used.

***** Example
	  Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:

	  Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))
	  vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
	  vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal

**** ActionEntry
	 An ActionEntry makes Keybindings accessible by the vim menu. It
	 takes a description and a Keybinding object and builds a menu entry
	 from this. The resulting object can be added to a Submenu object by
	 using the + operator.

***** Example
	  Map g{ to moving to parent heading in normal mode by using a Plug:

	  k = Keybinding('g{', Plug('OrgJumpToParentNormal', ':py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>'))
	  vim -> :nnoremap <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal :py ORGMODE.plugins["Navigator"].parent(mode="normal")<CR>
	  vim -> :nmap g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal

	  menu + ActionEntry('&Up', k)
	  vim -> :nmenu &Org.&Naviagte Headings.&Up<Tab>g{ <Plug>OrgJumpToParentNormal
